## ZUSAMMENFASSUNG (http://autosummarizer.com/index.php)
We assume that complex problems always require complex solutions.

We try to solve complexity by inventing tools and technologies to address a problem; but in the process we create another layer of complexity that, in turn, causes its own set of issues.

Obviously not every problem has a simple solution, and most complex tools exist because of real usecases.

The definition of best practice changes everytime a new technology arises, rendering the previous solution worthless garbage .

Of course they all solve specific problems - but that does not mean they are always the best solution, regardless of context.

Trying to assemble it, the engineers are surprised to find that the crew capsule is just an empty metal pod.

Sometimes the smarter way to build things is to try and take some pieces away, rather than add more to it.

They don't try to manage serverside code with clever abstractions - they don't have any.

## FAZIT
- teilweise die gleichen Kernsätze, aber hier öfter auch eher zusammenhanglose Sätze aus Illustrationen / Beispielen
